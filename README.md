# NFL_Elo

We aim to develop a web application that can be used to predict potential outcomes of NFL games based on each team's Elo rating. More about
Elo rating system can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system.

Hisotircal NFL data is used to determine the accuracy of our Elo algorithm and is pulled from this website: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/.

The first iteration calculated Elo scores based on the points scored by each team in each game throughout a given season. The next iteration is currently underway and we aim to imcorporate other data such as pass yards, rush yards, home field advantage, etc. in making our predictions more accurate.
